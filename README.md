# Stats 170
Stats 170 is Introduction to Time-Series Analysis, which I took under Professor Juana Sanchez in Fall of 2018. I have included 5 homework assignments (could not locate HW 4) and the final project. Please do not copy your homework assignments from my code and work; I have simply posted my solutions to showcase my skills in time series analysis in R. This class was much more challenging than expected because the class covered material vastly unfamiliar than the traditional Statistics major path. Unfamiliar territory combined with complex mathematical and practical data intution made this class intriguing, yet very time-consuming. Spending an average of 12-15 hours each week outside of class time to digest this material has given me the skills required to analyze time series data, providing me with the confidence and tools required to forecast time series data. The modelling techniques covered in this class include ARIMA/SARIMA, GARCH, Regression with Autocorrelated Errors, and VAR. Many other testing techniques to cover assumptions were learned as well, all of which can be detailled in the final project or throughout the homework assignments.
