## Time Series Analysis: Final Project

### Introduction
This comprehensive 27 page report details all of the major modelling techniques learned in this class. Taking well over 30 hours to complete, this final project culminated as a capstone project for the class. The project attempts to predict housing starts, a variable that represents the total number of new, privately owned housing using women's unemployment rate and civilian unemployment rate.

### Contents
Using a combination of LaTeX and RMD, the following sections are thoroughly examined: introduction, describing the data, descriptive analysis of the data, modelling SARIM + GARCH, modelling regression with autocorrelated errors, modelling VAR, and forecasts and conclusions (the report is in the .pdf). As evident, this complete guide examines all underlying assumptions for each of the modelling techniques and finds the most appropriate model after dozens of rounds of trial and error in conjunction with mathematical and practical intuition. 

### Conclusions
You'll have to see for yourself to learn how 3 different methods were used to forecast a consensus forecast.
