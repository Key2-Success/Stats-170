## HW 3

Homework 3 marked the start of more detailled and complicated analyses. From this homework onward, I spent an extraordinary amount of time understanding the math and intuition behind time series analysis since these concepts were foreign to me beforehand. Anyway, this homework explores stabilization of variances, analyzing ACFs and PACFs, using differencing methods to make the data stationary, fitting appropriate models based off ACFs and PACFs, selecting models based off white noise residuals, finding models with significant coefficients, calculating AIC/estimated sigma squared/RMSE of different models, fitting appropriate ARIMA models, forecasting the model by deriving an equation, and fitting a final model equation with a forecasted plot. Phew! That was a lot of ground to cover in one homework assignment, but such in-depth analyses are required for time-series analyses and will find its way into subsequent homework assignments (which, again required 8-10+ hours of work).
